# Week 2 Second Pass

## Functions

Whiteboarding time!  On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you feeling about functions?  Form groups of 3 with numbers *similar* to yours, then try to attack the following problem on a whiteboard:

The dev team is looking for a function that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns the following value: `add a to b, then multiply that value by b plus 4`

1. Define this function
2. Call this function twice with different `a` and `b` values
3. Write out the result for these two calls

Those who are on the 4 or 5 side, try the following challenge:

Do the same three steps as above with the following function description: `grab an element with the id "math-result" and add the value to this element`.

## Callbacks

First, let's look at a [simple example](http://dreamerslab.com/blog/en/javascript-callbacks/) of callback use.

Now, team up in your squads.  On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are each of you about callbacks?  The lowest number in the squad should type out a solution for the following, and the rest of the team should help out or research:

The dev team is looking for a new function.  We want to print out "first part is ready" immediately.  We want to print out "second part is ready" 3 seconds later.

1. Define this function
2. Call this function in dev tools
3. Verify the time difference is about three seconds

Those who are looking for a challenge, add the following feature: `print out "page is refreshed" every 4 seconds` (we update our databse every 4 seconds).

## jQuery

Let us revisit the [intermediate-jquery](https://github.com/den-materials/intermediate-jquery) lab to run through the final exercise.  This will reinforce a lot of our jQuery concepts.

## OOP and Prototypal Inheritance

OOP is hard.  I am currently looking for a good resource to better explain this complicated concept in Javascript.  Stay tuned!
