# Week 2 Second Pass

## Functions

Whiteboarding time!  On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you feeling about functions?  Form groups of 3 with numbers *similar* to yours, then try to attack the following problem on a whiteboard:

The dev team is looking for a function that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns the following value: `add a to b, then multiply that value by b plus 4`

1. Define this function
2. Call this function twice with different `a` and `b` values
3. Write out the result for these two calls

Those who are on the 4 or 5 side, try the following challenge:

Do the same three steps as above with the following function description: `grab an element with the id "math-result" and add the value to this element`.
